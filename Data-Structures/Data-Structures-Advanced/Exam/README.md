# These are the author's solutions with which the tests were generated.

**NOTE**: These are not the best solutions for the exam, in fact they are pretty bad in some aspects.
This is intentional as we cannot always expect a perfect solution. This is an average solution, which has
some very bad performance issues but overall performs well, which is why the tests were generated with it.

**NOTE**: The Performance tests in the Judge system differ from the tests you will see in this repository.
They differ in the time expect in the sense that it was increased. This is to compensate for the load that the
Judge System experiences sometimes and the slowness of execution of Submissions.
